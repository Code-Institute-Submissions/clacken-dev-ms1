## Design 

- Colour Scheme

    - The main theme for the site revolves around neutral tones, pastels and dark colours. This is kept from being too heavy by adding light sections and colours for relief.
        The idea for having a dark theme was to convey the idea of strength, power and determination, as opposed to a light theme such as a hotel gym which conveys more the idea
        of health and realtively light exercise such as treadmill. 
        The colours are also used to break up the sections into their respective areas and make the page styling quite dynamic. The colour red is used for section headings as this
        symbolises action, strength, energy and passion. The positive effect of the colour red is that it attracts attention, motivates and stimulates the user and also gives feelings
        of courage and confidence. These are all useful reactions as they are directly related to fitness and exercise, especially powerful and dynamic movements such the ones offered at Gym World. 

- Typography
     - The typography used needed to be strong in order to impart in the user the power of the Gym World brand and by extension the classes and results which are offered. 
        Two fonts are used across the site, Oswald for the headings and Poppins for the body text. Oswald is a clean, strong font which achieves the site's goals nicely of 
        giving a sense of strength. Poppins is also a strong font, has a nice clean style and suitably compliments the Oswald headings.

- Imagery
    - The imagery plays a crucial role for this site. It is designed to attract the users attention with captivating photos as well as motivate and inspire them. 
        Images of professional trainers convey the professionalism of the staff and instills trust in the organisation and its operation. The gallery section on the website gives
        the user a good idea of the gym setup, equipment, classes and the general operation environment. The large and dramatic hero image on the landing page is designed to give a 
        striking first impression and show that Gym World is all about results, power and strength. Smaller hero images are used across the rest of the pages which relate to the page content.
        Classes are shown in the Classes page which gives a good idea of the class types and how they are run and organised, while a photo of a gym space on the About page gives a good idea
        of the gym layout and setup and therefore provides information about the gym through the picture. The images choses also complement the colour scheme of the site by including neutral tones 
        and dark shades.

# Features
- Responsive across device sizes
    - The aspect ratios of photos and sections adapt to the device size and the site aesthetics are maintained at all viewing sizes.
- Includes interactive elements such as navlinks, clickable buttons and carousels
    - The user can see which navbar link is active by a white line under the link. Buttons change colour when hovered over to give an indication of where the user is and to encourage
    them to click on buttons, ultimately with the goal of having them sign up or contact the gym for information.
- Form for submitting information and requests
    - The about page features a sign up/contact form which the user can fill in with their name, email address and message. They can then click the submit button and will be informed if they
    have filled in all necessary fields or not.
- Interactive testimonials carousel
    - The home page features testimonials which are displayed in a grid system in the desktop view but which become a scrolling carousel on mobile. This makes the page cleaner and also 
adds a nice interactive element which grabs the user's attention.
- Dropdown menu on mobile
    - On mobile the navbar menu is hidden originally and the hamburger menu icon is visible. Clicking on this drops down the menu. This maximises real estate on mobile devices, keeps the page 
    clean and free from clutter and also keeps the user engaged as they navigate from page to page.

        following the sign up button to the form on the about page or scrolling down the page. Scrolling down the page reveals the benfits of this gym and also 
        provides another button which will bring the user to the classes page. Further past that is a section which introduces the gym trainers. All the necessary information

        For information about the classes they will either have navigated to the classes page via the button on the home page or from the navigation menu. On this page the information 
        is logically structured and clearly laid out in a way which is easy to read and understand. All the information regarding the classes, class times and experience is easily available

        bring them to the about page where they can fill in the form. They can also navigate to the about page from the navigation menu and will also find the contact form, clearly labelled
