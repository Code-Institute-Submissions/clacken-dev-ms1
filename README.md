    - Typography
        - **To Be Decided**

    - Imagery
        - The imagery plays a fundamental aspect for this site. It is designed to attract the users attention with striking photos as well as motivate and inspire them. 
        Images of professional trainers convey the professionalism of the staff and instills trust in the organisation and its operation. The gallery section on the website gives
        the user a good idea of the gym setup, equipment, classes and the general operation environment.
